# To Do

1. ~~finish main features that planned to implement~~
2. ~~extension commands for video-viewer/imagenet/detectnet/segnet/posenet~~
3. adaptive Open IPC link management
4. stabilizer doesn't seem to be that stabilized
5. ~~optimize yolo performance~~
6. follow me Rover drive
7. ~~add Ultralytics YOLO11 on NVIDIA Jetson using DeepStream SDK and TensorRT~~
8. ~~add DeepStream analysis~~
9. ~~add ByteTrack analysis~~
10. [ [Request] Add RTP H265 support #1 ](https://github.com/SnapDragonfly/jetson-yolo/issues/1)
11. optimize performance, especially AI model/tracking algorithm etc.
12. improve FPS rate over/up to 60FPS when dsyolo using BYTETrack
13. how to keep the bounding boxes when interval is NOT zero?
